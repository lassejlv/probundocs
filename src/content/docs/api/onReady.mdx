`onReady` is a simple helper event, that is triggered when the server is ready to accept requests.

```typescript
import { Probun } from 'probun';

Probun({
  port: 3000,
  routes: 'routes',
  // type-safe btw :)
  onReady: ({ port }) => {
    console.log(`listening on port http://localhost:${port}`);
  },
});
```
