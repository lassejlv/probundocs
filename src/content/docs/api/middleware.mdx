Probun has a middleware system that allows you to run code before and after each route.

## Creating Middleware

```typescript
import type { Next } from 'probun';

const myMiddleware = async (req: Request, next: Next) => {
  console.log('My Middleware');
};
```

## Using Middleware

```typescript
import { Probun } from 'probun';
import { myMiddleware } from './middleware';

Probun({
  port: 3000,
  routes: 'routes',
  middleware: [myMiddleware],
});
```
