The context object is passed to each route function in Probun. It contains information about the request and response.
Like express has req and res, Probun has a context object.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type ContextType = {
  json: (json: object, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  pretty: (json: object, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  text: (text: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  html: (html: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  error: (message: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  success: (message: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  redirect: (url: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  sendFile: (filePath: string, status?: number) => Promise<Response>;
  readHtml: (filePath: string) => Promise<string>;
  req: Request;
  params: Record<string, string>;
  query: Record<string, string>;
};
```
