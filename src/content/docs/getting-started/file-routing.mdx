title: File Routing
description: Get started with Probun's file-based routing system.
---

Probuns file routing is the same style as Next.js pages router. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.

### How it works

Probun uses the file system as an API. Each file inside the `routes` directory is treated as a route. The file name is the route path and the name of methods are exported functions.

### Example

```typescript
import type { Route } from 'probun';

export const GET = async (c: Route): Promise<Response> => {
  return c.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
};
```

In the example above, we have a file called `index.ts` inside the `routes` directory. This file contains a function called `GET` that returns a JSON response.

When you visit `http://localhost:3000`, you will see the JSON response `{"message":"Hello, World!"}`.

### Supported Methods

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE
- PATCH

### Params and query

You can access params and query from the context object.

```typescript
import type { Route } from 'probun';

export const GET = async (c: Route): Promise<Response> => {
  const { params, query } = c;

  return c.json({ params, query });
};
```
