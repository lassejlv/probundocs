ProBun is a fast, lightweight file-based routing system for Bun servers. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.

## Installation

You must have [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed before you can use Probun.

If you have Bun installed, you can install Probun using the following command:

```bash
mkdir my-probun-app && bun init -y
```

```bash
bun install probun@latest
```

```bash
cd my-probun-app && mkdir routes
```

## Creating a Route

Here we will create a simple get route that returns a JSON response. Create a new file in the `routes` directory called `index.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
export const GET = async (c: Context): Promise<Response> {

  return c.json({ message: 'Hello, World!' });
}
```

## Running the Server

In your index.ts (not in the routes directory), add the following code:

```typescript
import { Probun } from 'probun';

Probun({
  port: 3000,
  routes: 'routes',
});
```

Now you can run your server using the following command:

```bash
bun --watch index.ts
```

Now you can visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see your server running.
